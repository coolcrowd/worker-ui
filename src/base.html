     a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.

     3. You can always get the most recent stable version from the URL below.
     If you want the newest features (unstable!), use the 'edge' version instead:

         http://cdn.ractivejs.org/edge/ractive.min.js

     If you need IE8 support, change 'ractive' to 'ractive-legacy'.
